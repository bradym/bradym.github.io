<a href=#never-do-business-with-a-company-that-doesnt-provide-phone-support class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h3><p>When I originally registered my domain names I didn&rsquo;t care that
Namesecure didn&rsquo;t have phone support because I figured I could take care
of most things myself, and e-mail is easier to deal with anyways.</p><p>But when a problem came along, I learned the value of phone support. Had
I been able to call at the first sign of a problem and speak with
someone in a support department it would have probably been resolved
within a week or so.</p><h3 id=make-sure-the-registrar-offers-all-of-the-services-you-want>Make sure the registrar offers all of the services you want
<a href=#make-sure-the-registrar-offers-all-of-the-services-you-want class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h3><p>Is it important to you to be able to manage your DNS entries yourself?
Do you need e-mail forwarding? Will you need to change/add subdomains on
a frequent basis or on a whim?</p><p>Make sure the company you choose will allow you to do what you need to
do! Had I originally chosen a company that provided all of the features
I now want to use I wouldn&rsquo;t have had to transfer my domains in the
first place.</p><h3 id=my-recommendation>My recommendation
<a href=#my-recommendation class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h3><p>I highly recommend <a href=http://domainsite.com target=_blank>Domainsite</a> as a registrar.
They give you complete access to your domain name and DNS entries though
their website that works well and is easy to use. They also have very
good prices for domain name registration.</p><p>When you have a problem or question, they have great support.
<a href=http://domainsite.com target=_blank>Domainsite</a> has their mailing address, phone
number, and support e-mail address right on the top of every page on
their website.</p><p>Just a note: I am not an employee of
<a href=http://domainsite.com target=_blank>Domainsite
</a>, just a satisfied customer.</p></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://www.bradym.net/misc/cant-get-jcalendar-to-select-a-specific-date-when-opening.html><span class=button__icon>←</span>
